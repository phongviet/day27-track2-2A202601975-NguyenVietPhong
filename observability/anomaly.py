`zscore_detector` is kept as-is (simple, well-understood baseline). `auto`
mode is context-aware: it prefers a same-segment baseline (e.g. same weekday)
when the caller provides one, and uses a robust median/MAD statistic instead
of mean/std whenever there is enough history, falling back to z-score for
